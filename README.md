# Weather Station

A Collaboration project between TARpv17 and TARpe17 groups, at TTHK.

People involved:

TARpv17

Danil Gritsenko
Daniil Jefremov

TARpe17

Kristofer Latt
Steven Koska

---------------------------------

# The Goal

The goal is to make a small arduino device which can show current temperature and humidity in the room, additionally we can make design for it (Perhaps using 3D Printer)


# Brainstorm

Danil – ~~Button to change temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit~~ - Not possible, we need a switch, don't have one

Kristofer – Show local time above temperature/humidity

~~Kristofer – Add symbols (water, temperature etc)~~ - Not possible due to limited LCD hardware

# Components we need

Arduino plate
Temperature reader
Humidity reader
LCD Screen
Button
Battery
Wires
Resistors

# Roles

# PLANNING

# Product Backlog
- Plan the Design (Using 3D Modelling software)
- Ability to see local time

~~- Use symbols in LCD screen~~ - Not possible due to limited LCD hardware
# Sprint (In Progress)
- Find Components
- Testing (Current Version)
# Done
- GITHUB Readme
- Code Prototype
- Assemble Arduino
