# Weather Station

A Collaboration project between TARpv17 and TARpe17 groups, at TTHK.

People involved:

TARpv17

Danil Gritsenko
Daniil Jefremov

TARpe17

Kristofer Latt
Steven Koska

---------------------------------

# The Goal

The goal is to make a small arduino device which can show current temperature and humidity in the room, additionally we can make design for it (Perhaps using 3D Printer)


# Brainstorm

Danil – Button to change temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
Kristofer – Show local time above temperature/humidity
Kristofer – Add symbols (water, temperature etc)

# Components we need

Arduino plate
Temperature reader
Humidity reader
LCD Screen
Button
Battery
Wires
Resistors

# Roles

# PLANNING

# Product Backlog
- Plan the Design (Using 3D Modelling software)
- Ability to see local time
- Use symbols in LCD screen
# Sprint (In Progress)

- GITHUB Readme
- Code Prototype
- Assemble Arduino
- Find Components
- Testing
# Done
